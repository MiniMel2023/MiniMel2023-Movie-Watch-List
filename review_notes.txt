<<What I would do differently knowing what I know now / Where I think I could have improved it>>

Main goal was to try and create a simple app that could execute the CRUD operations

General
Inverse some logic to check for the negative first instead
Naming could have been cleaner - bit inconsitent
-Attempted to group "doing" things together and put everything else on "home" as secondary (Home is technically the "R")

Views
Could have added "includes" to reuse some templates like nav and styling
Could delve into better styling, templating, more intermediate CSS

Routes
Adding route filters in app.js to neaten up the route names - there were some issues during deployment which required a change

Models
Interesting learning about schemas, basically just Frankensteined one together from course examples

Controllers
Utilized Mongoose built in functions
Basically retro-fitted from course material
